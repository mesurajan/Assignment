---->Operators and Operand :

1.  Write a Python program to calculate the area and circumference of a circle with a given radius from terminal.
    2.Write a Python program that acts as a simple arithmetic calculator. The program should prompt the user to enter two numbers and an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Based on the user's input, the program should perform the corresponding operation and display the result. Ensure proper handling of division by zero.

--->List :

1.Create a list of integers and then write a Python program to find the sum of all the elements in the list.
2.WAP to demonstrate the use case of insert() and extend() methods in Python lists.
3.Write a program to remove duplicate elements from a list.

--->Strings :

1.Reverse a given string without using the reverse function or slicing.
2.Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome.
3.Explain the difference between the find() and index() methods for strings.
4.Write a Python program to print the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number using a loop.
5.Create a program that uses a loop to print the multiplication table of a given number.
6.Implement a program that counts the number of vowels in a given string using a loop.

---->Steps for
Fibonacci sequence :
-Start with the initial sequence: [0, 1]
-Calculate the next term: 0 + 1 = 1
-Append 1 to the sequence: [0, 1, 1]
-Calculate the next term: 1 + 1 = 2
-Append 2 to the sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2]
-Calculate the next term: 1 + 2 = 3
-Append 3 to the sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
-Calculate the next term: 2 + 3 = 5
-Append 5 to the sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
-Calculate the nth term: x + n = x + n
-Append x + n to the sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, . . . . . , x + n ]
